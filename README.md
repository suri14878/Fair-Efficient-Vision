# FAIR-EFFICIENT-VISION : Efficient and Fair Detection of Glaucoma & Diabetic Retinopathy

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging Vision Transformer (ViT) models for the detection of retinal diseases, specifically glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy (DR). While achieving high diagnostic performance, the project also addresses fairness concerns to mitigate biases based on sensitive demographic factors (e.g., race, gender, ethnicity, language, marital status). The methodology integrates knowledge distillation and post-processing fairness techniques to ensure equitable outcomes across diverse populations.

---

## Objectives

1. **Model Performance**:
   - Train a ViT-Large (teacher) model using a glaucoma dataset to establish a robust baseline.
   - Use knowledge distillation to train a compact ViT-Base (student) model on a combined glaucoma and DR dataset.
   - Achieve comparable or improved diagnostic performance with the student model (AUROC).

2. **Fairness**:
   - Apply post-processing fairness methods to reduce biases across demographic attributes.
   - Evaluate model fairness and performance trade-offs to ensure equitable and reliable predictions.

## Methodology

### 1. **Teacher Model Training (RETFound)**
- **Model**: RetFound MAE (Masked Autoencoders for retinal imaging).
- **Dataset**: Glaucoma dataset with 10,000 subjects.
- **Goal**: Achieve high AUROC by pretraining on meaningful visual representations and fine-tuning for disease prediction.

### 2. **Student Model Training (ViT-Base)**
- **Model**: ViT-Base trained via knowledge distillation.
- **Dataset**: Combined glaucoma and DR dataset (10,000 subjects each).
- **Goal**: Efficient and generalizable student model with balanced accuracy and scalability.

### 3. **Post-Processing Fairness Method**
- **Methodology**: Based on graph smoothing via Laplacian regularization.
- **Goal**: Treat similar individuals equitably and reduce disparities across demographic groups.
- **Fairness Metrics**: Address biases in Race, Gender, Language, Marital Status, and Ethnicity.
